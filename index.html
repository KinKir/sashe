Autoplay Policy Changes - April of 2018
---------------------------------------
Note: The Autoplay Policy launched in M66 Stable for audio and video elements and is effectively blocking roughly half of
unwanted media autoplays in Chrome. For the Web Audio API, the autoplay policy will launch in M71. This affects web games,
some WebRTC applications, and other web pages using audio features. Developers will need to update their code to take
advantage of the policy. More details can be found in the Web Audio API section below.

Chrome's autoplay policies are simple:

* Muted autoplay is always allowed.

* Autoplay with sound is allowed if:
* User has interacted with the domain (click, tap, etc.).
* On desktop, the user's Media Engagement Index threshold has been crossed, meaning the user has previously play video with sound.
* On mobile, the user has [added the site to their home screen].
* Top frames can delegate autoplay permission to their iframes to allow autoplay with sound.
